# Introduction to the ADALM-PLUTO SDR

Dr. Travis Collins and Robin Getz, Analog Devices

This workshop will provide a thorough and practical introduction to the AD9361, the ADALM-PLUTO SDR, and other IIO based hardware and the open-source software toolchain (IIO utils and IIO-Scope). We will examine the hardware and architecture of the PLUTO software-defined radio in addition to discussing topics such as how to get started using a new PLUTOSDR device, how to install and configure the open-source software toolchain, programming the PLUTO using the libIIO API from Python, C or C++, and other tools using PLUTO SDR. Other hardware capable of running the IIO framework will be discussed, such as the Ettus E310, the Epiq SideKiq Z2, and Analog Deviceâ€™s RF SOM. Several exercises will be performed on the ADALM-PLUTO SDR, such as implementing an FM transmitter and receiver. Various demonstrations of other wireless systems will be shown. For those interested in MATLAB or Simulink the Pluto Hardware support package will be shown.

Attendees should come away with a solid foundation and practical understanding of how to configure, program, and use the Pluto SDR and other IIO based hardware to implement a wide range of wireless systems.
